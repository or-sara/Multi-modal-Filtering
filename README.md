# Multi-modal_Joint_Image_Restoration

The inputs are signals captured from the same position by different sensors which are called multi-modal.
For example, RGB image (3 channels), infrared (single channel), depth image (single channel) are different images
of different modality. Besides, RGB images taken from the same camera and position but different ambient can
be viewed as multi-modal images. For instance, day and night shot, flash and no flash shots are examples of this 
category.

Aim:
Filter a trget image by the guidance of different modality images to improve the target image. We show different 
appliations here:
